## Technical Details

This tool is built as a self-contained JavaScript bookmarklet with no external dependencies. It works by:

1. Injecting custom CSS for the user interface
2. Calculating the target date based on user input
3. Finding and automating clicks on the "Load More" button
4. Tracking progress by monitoring loaded date ranges
5. Providing visual feedback through a status interface

The code is organized using modern JavaScript practices with a focus on maintainability and user experience.

## Development

### Project Structure

- `bookmarklet.js` - The unminified source code with full formatting and comments
- `bookmarklet-minify.js` - The minified version for use as a browser bookmarklet

### Building

To rebuild the minified version:

1. Edit `bookmarklet.js` as needed.
2. Run the `build-bookmarklet.js` script to generate the minified file. For example:
   ```bash
   node build-bookmarklet.js
   ```
3. The minified file will be created as `bookmarklet-minify.js` in the project directory.
4. Ensure the minified code is properly URI-encoded if needed for the bookmarklet.
